                <p>Hello and welcome to my website</p>
                <p> My name is Kevin Rumboldt, I am a student 3rd year at John Abbott college who is aspiring to become a programmer.<br>
                    I’m currently in my last semester of the 3 years and it’s ending soon. As the next year opens up, I shall be 3rd year graduating computer science student.<br>
                    Right now, I am currently building a horror video game with some friends so that we can feel the accomplishments of our effort for our selves.
                    What I like about my program is how it is general, allowing me to try or test out other way that I can use coding as well as what is available.
                    As I am now, I’m looking for possibly job positions in the cyber security field and game design fields as I have had a fascination for it. 

                </p>
                <p>In less formality I’m just a big stocky guy who loves video games. I am currently living in Montreal for the last 16 years, but I was born in Alberta.
                   I am not a picky person but, I do enjoy my self some spaghetti and tacos.
