                <p> My name is Kevin Rumboldt, I am a student 3rd year at John Abbott college who is aspiring to become a programmer.<br>
                    I’m currently in my last semester of the 3 years and it’s coming to an end soon. As the next year opens up, I shall be 3rd year graduating computer science student.<br>
                    What I like about my program is how it's very open and not too specific in how to complete a task, allowing me to try or test out other way's that I can code the task, as well as what is available in the software I am useing.
                    As I am now, I’m looking for possibly job positions in the fields of cyber security and game design as I have had a large fascination for it.

                    In less formality I’m just a big stocky guy who loves video games. I am currently living in Montreal for the last 16 years, but I was born in Alberta.
                    I am not a picky person but, I do enjoy my self some spaghetti and tacos.
