                <p> Since at a young age I have spent most of my childhood playing video Games which made them became a very big part of my life, and I have always wondered how are these games made how are is there so much detail inside of a small CD. 
                    I Began to wonder on the idea that maybe these video games are videos and I’m not really playing them. 
                    So, when I got older, I began to research about alot of different types of way’s games worked and why they worked and then it brought me to the program of interest, Computer science. 
                    Now from my effort in High School I am in computer science and after being in here for 2years and a half I have now discovered the beauty of the program and how fun an interactive It is. 
                    As such, when it comes to video games the more, I play them the more I wish to know about what happens behind the screen. 
                    For The future of gaming is never the same.

                    <img alt="Robot reading a news paper" src="Images/Phone_AI_Robot.jpg"

                        srcset="Images/AI_Brain_Tablets.jpg 602w, Images/AI_Brain_Computer.jpg 903w">
                </div>
                <p> When I was young, I was also into robotics since they are the future of society. 
                    Yet the more I thought about it the more I wanted to be involved in this future for humanity. 
                    As such I looked at how robots are able to move on their own. 
                    I found out about how they are coded to follow certain set of predefined instructions for only a handful of situations corresponding to its task. 
                    So for me to be able to become part of the Future I found I needed to get into Computer science. 
                    So now while I’m in the program these ideas motivate me to see if someday the things that I make will aid society.
